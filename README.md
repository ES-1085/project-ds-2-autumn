## Summary

The dataset that we chose comprises morphometric measurements and reproductive information from sea otters captured or obtained (through experimental harvesting or post-Exxon Valdez Oil Spill recovery efforts) in Alaska between 1947 and 2019 by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Data collected include various physical dimensions such as total body length, tail length, body mass, axillary girth, paw width, canine diameter, and baculum length, alongside details concerning sex, age, and reproductive status. For female otters with dependent pups, additional data encompass pup sex, mass, and total length when accessible. In cases of harvested animals, the dataset also includes pregnancy status and details regarding fetal sex, mass, and length. These data originate from experimental harvests conducted primarily during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as from sea otter captures associated with USFWS and USGS sampling and tagging endeavors conducted from the late 1980s through 2019, or from otters recovered deceased during the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil spill (EVOS).

The USGS study investigated the effects of the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil spill on the sea otter population, utilizing data spanning several decades. Findings reveal significant differences in various characteristics of otters captured before and after the spill. Specifically, adult sea otters in the Western Aleutians were notably heavier before the spill, indicating a potential impact on their overall health and condition. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the baculum length of adult male otters post-spill, suggesting possible adaptations or responses to environmental changes. However, body length remained unaffected by the spill. Additionally, otters captured before the spill were notably older than those captured after, indicating potential shifts in population demographics.

Our final project investigated the effects of the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil spill on the sea otter population, utilizing data spanning several decades. Findings reveal significant differences in various characteristics of otters captured before and after the spill. Specifically, adult sea otters in the Western Aleutians were notably heavier before the spill, indicating a potential impact on their overall health and condition. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the baculum length of adult male otters post-spill, suggesting possible adaptations or responses to environmental changes. However, body length remained unaffected by the spill. Additionally, otters captured before the spill were notably older than those captured after, indicating potential shifts in population demographics.

In addition to this, our study delves into various morphometric characteristics of sea otters, aiming to discern differences based on sex and age within the dataset. Firstly, tail lengths were compared between mature male and female otters, with the former exhibiting significantly longer tails. Similarly, total body lengths were contrasted, revealing a notable difference between mature males and females, with adult males having significantly longer bodies. Additionally, paw width measurements demonstrated that male otters had significantly larger paw sizes compared to females, potentially indicative of foraging behavior. Furthermore, canine width emerged as a reliable metric for sexing sea otters, with females displaying significantly smaller canine lengths compared to males. Lastly, baculum length was explored as an age estimator for male otters, with statistical analysis indicating significant differences among age groups, particularly for individuals aged seven and younger. 

## Navigating the Project Folder
There are a variety of subfolders and files that are pivotal for the analysis of this project, including .Rmd, .md, .shapefiles, and others. 

For the data dictionary, navigate to the `README.md` file located within the `data` folder. This details what each variable represents. 

To begin analyzing the data, navigate to the `data_tidying.rmd` in the `data_analysis` folder. This contains the code that is needed to clean the USGS datasets into readable formats. These cleaned files are the base files for the next .Rmd files. 

For statistical analysis on morphometric measurements, navigate to the `analysis.Rmd` file within the `data_analysis` folder.

For analysis on the effect of the ExxonMobil Oil Spill in Prince William's Sound in 1989, navigate to the `oilspillanalysis.Rmd` file within the `data_analysis` folder.

For analysis on the effects of isolation of sea otter populations, navigate to the `islandbiogeography.Rmd` file within the `data_analysis` folder.

For the animated map of Alaska and captures, navigate to the `leafmap.Rmd` file within the `data_analysis` folder.
